Welcome to my project.
As we all know that Ola is an important application that takes care of us in every day-to-day
activity.
Whether to go to work or roaming around the city with our family and friends, Ola is a must
have thing inside our phone.
Today we will go through each process of the Ola rides based on a dataset to build a pipeline to
find out all those meaningful information like how much travel people does and how much cost
is there to find out what is there for benefit of the company in terms of revenue and cost
management.
We can also be able to see the travel destination across the maps in a global based view as well.
Sounds intriguing right? Let’s jump right into our project.
I’ve tried to explain each and every single parts of developing the project from scratch with a
clear view by which a person with a very little or no knowledge of the whole data engineering
field can also be able to understand what’s going on throughout this project.
The Idea behind the whole project is to store this raw data into the cloud storage, then as a
computing system, used the VM engine of google cloud and to run the MAGE AI into it to Load
the data, Transform the data and feedback the data into the table of BigQuery for Querying.
